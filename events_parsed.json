            "description": "<p>This is a SARTA event sponsored by Drexel University and should be very interesting and useful to all of us studying and/or implementing the Lean Startup methodologies.</p>\n<p>Details and Registration: <a href=\"http://www.sarta.org/LeanStartup.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.sarta.org/LeanStartup.html</a></p>\n<p>Course Description:</p>\n<p>Startups can seem mysterious. One skyrockets and another fails randomly but business doesn’t have to feel like voodoo; and success isn’t random. There’s a better way, a new science that’s researching why startups fail and how to make them succeed. The data shows that thousands of smart entrepreneurs have been doing it wrong. A startup is not a ‘business’, it is a ‘search for a business’. Most businesses, from Twitter to Groupon, didn’t start with the right idea. They figured it out on the way. What differentiates a successfully launched enterprise is one who can unearth the best ideas under duress - those who can find ‘“the pivot” - the point of reinvention when they realize that their original ideas need retooling. And, more critically, that they can find their market before they run out of money.</p>\n<p>Tristan will walk you through the lean startup methodology; a simple set of steps and specific checklists that guide entrepreneurs step-by-step through testing key assumptions, discovering the ‘killer’ problems, adapting around them, iterating to a proven solution and then successfully executing their business idea.</p>\n<p>Presenter</p>\n<p>Tristan Kromer <br />\n\nLean Startup Coach, LUXr; Coordinator &amp; Mentor, Lean Startup Circle</p>",
